Todo
----
check blog for photos with no link
    and links to my profile
subscribe spam - use the python mail module
links
look tweaking
    dt being bold and h3 being non-bold causes some weirdness (e.g advanced auth)
    when you hover over a named link, it looks bad

fbphoto
    check files are writable at start
    the main problem now is mismatches take ages
photo uprighting script
Consultancy
    link from other sections to advertise
Tweak adwords
    What are the options?

Big things
----------
Shithead
Learn debuggers
proving your profile pic is you - silly pose unique to the site
Sell TSRweb
Facebook app
rating and commenting/tagging photos on camera
facebook developments - become a crm
private area on website
Web app security scanner

Big things in computing:
    open social networking
    centralised place that checks for software updates


Pipp
----
check links
    update docs
    anchor exists
    external links
        wikipedia gives me forbidden - skip
        need a redirect="ok" flag on some links
    pippw
        by-source-page output
        popup html to manually check links & mailto

doctype - do better
More robust error handling
    if you make the stylesheet invalid, afterwards you need to restart pipp
        ** fixed now for map-view, not main

allow links in <desc> sections
autogen api from source
document jpeg comment stuff

--> pipp 2.0.3

tidy up simple_example
promote - someone must want it!

Efficiency improvement - separate copy-depend
    This avoids rebuilding the whole site when you update the stylesheet - important for incremental uploads
pipp-link for side-link with title

Long term things to do (never!)
----------------------
Links
  scatter around site but also have links page
  redirect to /outgoing/ so I can log them
Use CSS printing rules
Signup for accounts on pajhome
When pages are dynamic: can you find the hidden <b>%search_term%</b>
Knutsford Knews (wait for pipp2 and incremental uploads)
Accented character on Vigenere (iglooks font doesn't have e acute)


Logs / Stats
------------
log rotation - monthly gzip?
mail me filtered error log daily - if there are any real errors

HideRobots - finish
hide numerical referrers
... can do LOADS here!

For each host I want a report of their visits, which pages etc.
  (this is where you want cookies to know who people are!)
  start with how they got here
  time spent on each page
  % images loaded
  etc.
  links go to a redir CGI so I know how they leave

For each page I want a list of who's visited
Each day I get mailed a list of the daily activity
Able to view a recent views total at the bottom of every page
Logs - only show referres that actually contain a link back to me.
