<desc>What are all these funny pictures around the site?</desc>

<p>The pictures are photos from Chi Phat, a charming village in the Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia. The village is traditionally a rice producing community, and does not have running water or grid electricity. More recently, NGOs have come to the village, helping the inhabitants to create a sustainable tourism industry - Community Based Ecotourism (CBET). You can take trips by hiking, mountain bike or motor bike, with a guide to show you the way, and the option of camping. I spent a few days in the village in April 2009, including some of the Cambodian new year celebrations, and I was touched by the warmth and openness of the people. <a href="http://www.mountainbikingcardamoms.com/">more...</a></p>

<p>All the way from 1999 to 2009, the site had some dubious hand-drawn logos. They were mostly awful - I'm no artist - although the rave logo wasn't bad. Still, having any logos helped the visual feel of the site. In 2009 I decided it was time for the logos to be replaced. Photos seemed an obvious option, but I was on the road travelling, where could I photograph things like an office or a data centre? In my next stop at Chi Phat, I decided to improvise, and I like the results. The photos feel more personal and interesting than emotionless pictures of people in an office.</p>

I saw a few of these in fact. I guess the reality is that a shack house is quite adequate for this climate, and a satellite dish is considerably cheaper than a new house.</div>

Enough to make anyone ponder our existence! This was a tough choice - I considered a waterfall as well, but the sunset won in the end.</div>

The picture doesn't capture the security element of cryptography, but hey, it's emotive.</div>

He secures the track with this post and a rope.</div>

It's just a posed photo unfortunately, IT knowledge is not common in this village. Although an NGO in Phnom Penh is providing IT training for disadvantaged students.</div>

Holding a globe would have worked better, but I couldn't find one. I did consider a spider's web - we saw some impressive ones - but you can't really see the web on photos.</div>

This is purely a metaphor, for consultancy helping people build bridges. I'm pretty certain this particular bridge was built with local knowledge and no outside support.</div>
